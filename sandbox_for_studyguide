    Given a list of words and a letter, return a list of integers

    **DO NOT** use the `list.index()` method.
    
    For example::
    
        >>> find_letter_indices(['odd', 'dog', 'who'], 'o')

    ("o" is at index 0 in "odd", is at index 1 in "dog", and at
    index 2 in "who")
    
    If the letter doesn't occur in one of the words, use `None` for
    that word in the output list. For example::
    
        >>> find_letter_indices(['odd', 'dog', 'who', 'jumps'], 'o')
